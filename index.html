                            The Meta Rose Project is a collection of audio-visual artworks composed of 3D-based visuals and original soundtracks exploring the concept of life compared to a rose. <br>
                            <br> <br>
                            Roses have contradictory aspects, both having beautiful petals and thorns simultaneously. 
                            Life is like holding a beautiful rose with thorns, as it encompasses both positive and negative experiences, as well as states of joy and sorrow. 
                            There is no life without any challenge, just as every rose has its thorns. 
                            However, this reality does not change the fact that roses are beautiful. Similarly, your life is beautiful if you choose to see the beauty in it.
                        
                            <br> <br><br>
                            Each audio-visual artwork in the collection conveys the concept of inseparable mixed emotions, drawing parallels to roses and thorns, with each piece visually and sonically communicating with the others. Together, they form an interactive visual album for the audience.

                                Throughout the project, two contrasting visual symbols are employed:
                                <br> <br><br>
                               -  The first symbol represents positive emotions, energy, and life, depicted through the colour pink, rose petals, and flowing movements.
                                <br> <br><br>
                               -  The second symbol portrays non-positive emotions, challenges, and lifelessness, represented by the colour grey or chrome, thorns, and deep water.
                        
                                <br><br>

<!--                             The project will finish with an exhibition in Black Box inviting the audience to interact with the entire collection.

                            PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                        </h3>
                        <p class="minnie__info-description">
                            Humans rely on the memories they have accumulated since birth and react accordingly to these memories. How they think, their perspectives, responses, and the emotions they experience are calculated and computed by neurons formed through past memories. All these memories are gathered to form their thoughts and the system of emotions, which becomes their identity. Humans' thoughts cannot surpass their emotions. Therefore, emotions in humans are the measure of all things.
                            <br><br>
                            Emotion, from the perspective of quantum physics regarding the electromagnetic field inside the brain, is a form of energy, which means it is also a frequency (Idris, 2020). When humans feel something, they emit energy that can affect others, which, in turn, can affect themselves.
                           <br><br>
                           Even when the given experience is the same, individuals react and feel differently. 'Quantum Faces' provides the experience of AR face filters exploring emotions. This allows the audience to explore and observe their feelings, contemplate their pre-formed system of thoughts and emotions, and consider the effects of giving and receiving emotions/energy on one another.
                           The main question of the project is, 'If you had the choice to affect others either positively or negatively, what would you choose?'
                           <br><br>
                           Quantum Faces features 4 facial sculptures named with words created by the artist. They represent feelings that do not yet have words, undefined by language. By defining them and giving names to these feelings, it offers the opportunity to process these emotions and move forward, facilitating more effective communication between people.

                        “Reflethos”
                        <br>
                        The awareness that your mind is listening to what you are saying to yourself. 
                        <br><br>
                        A moment of realisation that your mind is listening to your words. It's as if you are looking at your inner consciousness as a different person, standing and staring one step away from this person. It's the moment of becoming aware of how your words hold vast and limitless power, demolishing any stereotypes, prejudices, biases, and preconceptions. It’s the feeling of being overwhelmed by the power of your words to yourself.
                        <br><br>
                        What are the words you have said to yourself today?

                        <br>
                        The feeling of desiring to understand your facial expressions.
                        <br><br>
                        It is when you realise how little attention you pay to look at yourself in the mirror and observe your facial expressions to process what you are going through. It becomes an explorative and speculative journey, an experience you have never encountered before. Your face feels stranger than ever.

                        It is believed that every individual perceives the world differently, considering it as a part of their own reality. The sense of awareness that others have varied perceptions of you implies the existence of different versions of yourself in this world.

                        Which version of yourself is the most authentic? Can any of them be considered your true self?

                        The feeling of knowing that a particular eye contact with someone will become etched in your memory, much like a vivid picture, which will remain as one of the most powerful images whenever you think about that person. It's as if you will never forget the piercing eyes of your partner or the affectionate eyes of your mother.
