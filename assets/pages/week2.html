                        <p>
                        In the first few days, I continued from last week on the production of the avatar, “Mintie,” and the final version of the metahuman was created.
                        Due to limited options with hair and clothing presets in Metahuman, custom hair and clothing had to be created for Mintie, resulting in the avatar being bald and wearing only underwear and default flip flops.
                    <br> <br>
                    With the completion of the basic avatar, here’s the list of things to complete for the final outcome, the video. 
                    I followed this list in a linear order:
                    <br> <br>
                    1. Exporting metahuman face and body mesh into Blender to combine them as one for use as an avatar in other softwares for hair and clothing.
                    <img src="../img/week211.png" alt="photos">
                    <br>2. Production of custom hair using Blender.
                    <img src="../img/week207.png" alt="photos">
                    <img src="../img/week209.png" alt="photos">
                    <br>3. Importing the exported hair FBX model into Unreal for binding hair and face mesh.
                    <img src="../img/week208.png" alt="photos">
                    <br>4. Production of custom clothing using Marvelous Designer.
                    <img src="../img/week210.png" alt="photos">
                    <img src="../img/week212.png" alt="photos">
                    <br>5. Choosing and Converting the Animation from Mixamo.
                    <br>6. Retargeting the animation to the metahuman body mesh in Unreal.
                    <img src="../img/week204.png" alt="photos">
                    <img src="../img/week205.png" alt="photos">
                    <br>7. Creating a sequence of metahuman with the retargeted animation.
                    <br>8. Exporting/Importing the animation to Marvelous Designer and Recording the clothing simulation.
                    <img src="../img/week213.png" alt="photos">
                    <br>9. Exporting/Importing the recorded simulation as a geometry cache into Unreal and adding it to the sequence.
                    <br>10. Setting up the environment in Unreal (Minimalist environment with one platform for Mintie to stand on).
                    <br>11. Setting up the cameras and lighting for rendering.
                    <br>12. Rendering!
                    <br> <br>
                    This workflow was challenging as it involved jumping back and forth between various software and numerous exporting and importing files to match the targeted software. Extensive research and watching tutorials were necessary for troubleshooting and figuring out how to make it all work!
                    <br> <br>
                    <img src="../img/week206.png" alt="photos">
                    One of the issues involved binding hair with the face mesh in Metahuman. The hair was not binding properly and was flopping around when the character was moving. I managed to find a solution on how to fix it by tweaking the rotation settings when importing the FBX model to Unreal. 
                    <br>Additionally, the hair is quite long and is penetrating into the body even after binding with the face mesh, which is attached to the body mesh. I've tried many different approaches to solve this problem, but some sources suggest that it's a known issue with Metahuman. I'm still trying to figure out how to resolve this issue.
                    <br> <br>
                    I’ve used Blender, Maya, and Unity in previous projects, but I have limited experience with Unreal. Additionally, it’s my very first time trying Marvelous Designer to create a digital garment. While I have some experience with pattern making or fashion design through the brand I work on with my brother, transitioning to digital or virtual processes was definitely challenging. However, I quite enjoyed the whole process and found it quite fun!
                    <br> <br>

                    Even with the completion of the first few renders, there are still a few steps to complete:
                    <br> <br>
                    13. Create a track
                    <br>14. Post production of audio and visuals in Premiere Pro
                    <br>15. Export it in various formats catered to the targeted platform, including 16:9 Basic Format, Portrait/Square format for Instagram, or mobile environment.

                            INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT

                        <p>
                        I’ve created a Google Doc specifically for the list of opportunities, including artist grants, residencies, artist meetups, and networking opportunities.

                        <br>As for this week’s industry engagement, I ended up applying to the Edenhope Artist Residency Program! 
                        <br>Edenhope Artist Residency is a local artist-run small business in Edenhope, Victoria, Australia. I thought it would be a great opportunity since the residency requires artists to be involved in regular public programs like workshops or artist talks within the community. Engaging with the community is one of my primary goals as an artist, so this would be perfect.

                        I also attended a performance by Liquid Architecture. The performance by Corin was really great! The visuals on the screen were awesome as well, although I wish they were more reactive to the sound or less repetitive and looped. But still, I enjoyed the performance so much! Overall, it was so inspirational that I wanted to create something right away. I wish I could offer a show to inspire other creative minds!

                        <br><br>
                        I met Isabella, the director of Seventh Gallery, there at the event after the zoom meeting. It was so great to see her in person and say hi! I also met other students and one of the former teachers. I'm so grateful to be able to attend these events to get involved in the creative community.

                            I was looking at my Instagram profile and realised I haven't fully caught up with the past project, "Quantum Faces," the facial sculptures. I decided to post short reels showcasing the details of the 3D sculptures. I have 5 models, including 4 that were showcased in "Quantum Faces" and 1 extra that was never showcased before. So I posted a reel for each sculpture.
